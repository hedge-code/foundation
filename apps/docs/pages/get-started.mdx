# Get Started

Foundation is a free and open-source components library for ReactJS with Tailwindcss inspired by popular designs such as Material Design, with minimum impact on the page theme.

## Installation

The package requires [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) and classnames packages too.

```sh npm2yarn copy
npm i classnames @hedgecode/foundation
```

Once you install `@hedgecode/foundation` you need to put the library path in the content section of tailwindcss configuration file.

```json copy
"./node_modules/@hedgecode/foundation/**/*.{cjs,mjs}"
```

Full example of the file:

```json filename="tailwindcss.config.ts" showLineNumbers {5}
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,md,mdx}",
    "./node_modules/@hedgecode/foundation/**/*.{cjs,mjs}"
  ],
  plugins: [],
}

```
